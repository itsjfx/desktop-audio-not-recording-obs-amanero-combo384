This issue is caused by any DAC, such as the Klein DAC, that uses the Amanero Combo384 sound card or a non default sample rate
I couldn't find any help online but saw people with similar issues, but here's the fix.

## How to fix
1. Check what sample rates your DAC or device supports: https://i.imgur.com/CY2QpMW.png
